Woaaaahhhh, rotating Ascii figures wooooo

- Saw a video on youtube that explained how rotating ascii figure worked, and
i decided to try that out.
Didnt do anything special (ive followed the tutorial), but I'm kinda happy with the piramid (made by scratch)

Did that just to learn how "rotation matrix" worked.
Should probably study a bit more because... I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING


P.S.
Thank you Symbolab for helping me with your calculations :_)
